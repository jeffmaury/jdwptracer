         * breakpoint request.  These events are delivered

         * The VM Start Event and VM Death Event are automatically generated events.
         * This means they do not need to be requested using the
         * <a href="#JDWP_EventRequest_Set">EventRequest.Set</a> command.
         * The VM Start event signals the completion of VM initialization. The VM Death
         * event signals the termination of the VM.
         * If there is a debugger connected at the time when an automatically generated
         * event occurs it is sent from the target VM. Automatically generated events may
         * also be requested using the EventRequest.Set command and thus multiple events
         * of the same event kind will be sent from the target VM when an event occurs.
         * Automatically generated events are sent with the requestID field
         * in the Event Data set to 0. The value of the suspendPolicy field in the
         * Event Data depends on the event. For the automatically generated VM Start
         * Event the value of suspendPolicy is not defined and is therefore implementation
         * or configuration specific. In the Sun implementation, for example, the
         * suspendPolicy is specified as an option to the JDWP agent at launch-time.
         * The automatically generated VM Death Event will have the suspendPolicy set to
         * NONE.
